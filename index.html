  <p> A computer is an electronic device that is really good at processing and storing information. There are seven parts in the computer that make it work. The main part of the computer is the CPU which stands for Central Processing Unit. The CPU is known for being the brain of the computer since it processes everything that goes on in the computer. The better CPU you have the better the computer is at processing stuff. Another important part of the computer is the GPU which stands for Graphics processing unit.</p>
