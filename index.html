  <h3> A computer is an electronic device that is really good at processing and storing information. You can do many things on a computer like work, watch videos, play games, and much more. In order for the computer to do all those things there are seven parts that allow the computer to do everything. The main part of the computer is the CPU which stands for Central Processing Unit. The CPU is known for being the brain of the computer since it processes everything that goes on in the computer. Most CPU's need a cooler to make sure your CPU does not heat up. The better CPU you have the better the computer is at processing stuff. Another important part of the computer is the GPU which stands for Graphics Processing Unit. The GPU is responsible for the graphics that you see in your computer and the FPS or Frames Per Second that you have. The better GPU you have the better graphics and FPS you will have. One other part of the computer you will need is the PSU or Power supply unit. The PSU is responsible for powering your computer. The amount of watts determines the amount of power your computer is getting. Another important part of the computer is the motherboard. the motherboard ties the components of the computer together so they can talk to each other. This is also where your CPU is inside the computer. Another part of a computer is the SSD which stands for solid-state drives. SSDs are responsible for storing all the long term data there is in a computer through flash memory. One other important part of a computer is the RAM that stands for random access memory and is responsible for storing short term data in the computer and the data that is stored is lost whenever the computer is turned off. The final component of the computer is the case which stores all the other major components inside of it. The case should also have fans inside of it so the fans can cool down the components to the computer so it doesn't overheat. The case will need at least 4 fans to cool the parts. When your computer is ready to be used you have to connect it to the moniter. The moniter is what displays everything that the computer does. You will have to connect a VGA or video graphics array cable to your computer then your moniter. See the links on the next page for the parts of the computer that you can purchase so you can build yor own. </h3>
