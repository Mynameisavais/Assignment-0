  <h3> A computer is an electronic device that is really good at processing and storing information. There are seven parts in the computer that make it work. The main part of the computer is the CPU which stands for Central Processing Unit. The CPU is known for being the brain of the computer since it processes everything that goes on in the computer. Most CPU's need a cooler to make sure your CPU does not heat up. The better CPU you have the better the computer is at processing stuff. Another important part of the computer is the GPU which stands for Graphics processing unit. The GPU is responsible for the graphics that you see in your computer and the FPS or frames per second that you have. The better GPU you have the better graphics and FPS you will have. One other part of the computer you will need is the PSU or Power supply unit. The PSU is responsible for powering your PC. The amount of watts determines the amount of power your PC is getting. Another important part of the PC is the motherboard. the motherboard ties the components of the computer together so they can talk to each other. This is also where your CPU is inside the PC. Another part of a computer is the SSD which stands for solid-state drives. SSDs are responsible for storing all the long term data there is in a PC through flash memory. One other important part of a PC is the RAM that stands for random access memory and is responsible for storing short term data in the computer and the data that is stored is lost whenever the computer is turned off. The final component of the computer is the case which stores all the other major components inside of it. The case should also have fans inside of it so the fans can cool down the components to the PC so it doesn't overheat. The case will need at least 4 fans to cool the parts. When your PC is ready to be used you have to connect it to the moniter. The moniter is what displays everything that the computer does. You will have to connect a VGA or video graphics array cable to your PC then your moniter. The links bellow will show you parts of the computer that you can buy so you can build your own. </h3>
